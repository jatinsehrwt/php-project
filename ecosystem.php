          Reefs are the big cities of the sea. They exist because the growth
          of corals matches or exceeds the death of corals – think of it as
          a race between the construction cranes (new coral skeleton) and
          the wrecking balls (the organisms that kill coral and chew their
          skeletons into sand).<br />
          When corals are babies floating in the plankton, they can be eaten
          by many animals. They are less tasty once they settle down and
          secrete a skeleton, but some fish, worms, snails and sea stars
          prey on adult corals. Crown-of-thorns sea stars are particularly
          voracious predators in many parts of the Pacific Ocean. Population
          explosions of these predators can result in a reef being covered
          with tens of thousands of these starfish, with most of the coral
          killed in less than a year.
          <br />
          Corals also have to worry about competitors. They use the same
          nematocysts that catch their food to sting other encroaching
          corals and keep them at bay. Seaweeds are a particularly dangerous
          competitor, as they typically grow much faster than corals and may
          contain nasty chemicals that injure the coral as well.
          <br />
          Corals do not have to only rely on themselves for their defenses
          because mutualisms (beneficial relationships) abound on coral
          reefs. The partnership between corals and their zooxanthellae is
          one of many examples of symbiosis, where different species live
          together and help each other. Some coral colonies have crabs and
          shrimps that live within their branches and defend their home
          against coral predators with their pincers. Parrotfish, in their
          quest to find seaweed, will often bite off chunks of coral and
          will later poop out the digested remains as sand. One kind of goby
          chews up a particularly nasty seaweed, and even benefits by
          becoming more poisonous itself.
