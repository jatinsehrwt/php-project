            Corals are related to sea anemones, and they all share the same
            simple structure, the polyp. The polyp is like a tin can open at
            just one end: the open end has a mouth surrounded by a ring of
            tentacles. The tentacles have stinging cells, called
            nematocysts, that allow the coral polyp to capture small
            organisms that swim too close. Inside the body of the polyp are
            digestive and reproductive tissues. Corals differ from sea
            anemones in their production of a mineral skeleton.
            <br />
            Shallow water corals that live in warm water often have another
            source of food, the <strong>zooxanthellae</strong> (pronounced
            zo-o-zan-THELL-ee). These single-celled algae photosynthesize
            and pass some of the food they make from the sun’s energy to
            their hosts, and in exchange the coral animal gives nutrients to
            the algae. It is this relationship that allows shallow water
            corals to grow fast enough to build the enormous structures we
            call reefs. The zooxanthellae also provide much of the green,
            brown, and reddish colors that corals have. The less common
            purple, blue, and mauve colors found in some corals the coral
            makes itself.

          <h2>Coral Diversity</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            In the so-called true stony corals, which compose most tropical
            reefs, each polyp sits in a cup made of calcium carbonate. Stony
            corals are the most important reef builders, but organpipe
            corals, precious red corals, and blue corals also have stony
            skeletons. There are also corals that use more flexible
            materials or tiny stiff rods to build their skeletons—the
            seafans and sea rods, the rubbery soft corals, and the black
            corals.
            <br />
            The family tree of the animals we call corals is complicated,
            and some groups are more closely related to each other than are
            others. All but the fire corals (named for their strong sting)
            are anthozoans, which are divided into two main groups. The
            hexacorals (including the true stony corals and black corals, as
            well as the sea anemones) have smooth tentacles, often in
            multiples of six, and the octocorals (soft corals, seafans,
            organpipe corals and blue corals) have eight tentacles, each of
            which has tiny branches running along the sides. All corals are
            in the phylum Cnidaria, the same as jellyfish.
