          The greatest threats to reefs are rising water temperatures and
          ocean acidification linked to rising carbon dioxide levels. High
          water temperatures cause corals to lose the microscopic algae that
          produce the food corals need—a condition known as
          <strong>coral bleaching</strong>.
          <br />
          Severe or prolonged bleaching can kill coral colonies or leave
          them vulnerable to other threats. Meanwhile, ocean acidification
          means more acidic seawater, which makes it more difficult for
          corals to build their calcium carbonate skeletons. And if
          acidification gets severe enough, it could even break apart the
          existing skeletons that already provide the structure for reefs.
          Scientists predict that by 2085 ocean conditions will be acidic
          enough for corals around the globe to begin to dissolve. For one
          reef in Hawaii this is already a reality.

          Unfortunately, warming and more acid seas are not the only threats
          to coral reefs. Overfishing and overharvesting of corals also
          disrupt reef ecosystems. If care is not taken, boat anchors and
          divers can scar reefs. Invasive species can also threaten coral
          reefs. The lionfish, native to Indo-Pacific waters, has a
          fast-growing population in waters of the Atlantic Ocean. With such
          large numbers the fish could greatly impact coral reef ecosystems
          through consumption of, and competition with, native coral reef
          animals.
          <br />
          Even activities that take place far from reefs can have an impact.
          Runoff from lawns, sewage, cities, and farms feeds algae that can
          overwhelm reefs . Deforestation hastens soil erosion, which clouds
          water—smothering corals.

        <h2>Coral bleaching</h2>

      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p class="lead">
          “Coral bleaching” occurs when coral polyps lose their symbiotic
          algae, the zooxanthellae. Without their zooxanthellae, the living
          tissues are nearly transparent, and you can see right through to
          the stony skeleton, which is white, hence the name coral
          bleaching. Many different kinds of stressors can cause coral
          bleaching – water that is too cold or too hot, too much or too
          little light, or the dilution of seawater by lots of fresh water
          can all cause coral bleaching.
          <br />
          The biggest cause of bleaching today has been rising temperatures
          caused by global warming. Temperatures more than 2 degrees F (or 1
          degree C) above the normal seasonal maximimum can cause bleaching.
          Bleached corals do not die right away, but if temperatures are
          very hot or are too warm for a long time, corals either die from
          starvation or disease. In 1998, 80 percent of the corals in the
          Indian Ocean bleached and 20 percent died.

          There is much that we can do locally to protect coral reefs, by
          making sure there is a healthy fish community and that the water
          surrounding the reefs is clean. Well-protected reefs today
          typically have much healthier coral populations, and are more
          resilient (better able to recover from natural disasters such as
          typhoons and hurricanes).
          <br />
          Fish play important roles on coral reefs, particularly the fish
          that eat seaweeds and keep them from smothering corals, which grow
          more slowly than the seaweeds. Fish also eat the predators of
          corals, such as crown of thorns starfish. Marine protected areas
          (MPAs) are an important tool for keeping reefs healthy.
          <br />
          Large MPAs protect the Great Barrier Reef and the Northwestern
          Hawaiian Islands, for example, and in June 2012, Australia created
          the largest marine reserve network in the world . Smaller ones,
          managed by local communities, have been very successful in
          developing countries.
          <br />
          Clean water is also important. Erosion on land causes rivers to
          dump mud on reefs, smothering and killing corals. Seawater with
          too many nutrients speeds up the growth of seaweeds and increases
          the food for predators of corals when they are developing as
          larvae in the plankton. Clean water depends on careful use of the
          land, avoiding too many fertilizers and erosion caused by
          deforestation and certain construction practices. In the long run,
          however, the future of coral reefs will depend on reducing carbon
          dioxide in the atmosphere, which is increasing rapidly due to
          burning of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide is both warming the ocean,
          resulting in coral bleaching, and changing the chemistry of the
          ocean, causing ocean acidification. Both making it harder for
          corals to build their skeletons.
